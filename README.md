Feedforward Neural Networks, also known as Deep feedforward Networks or Multi-layer Perceptrons, are the focus of this article. For example, Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (which are used extensively in computer vision applications) are based on these networks. Weâ€™ll do our best to grasp the key ideas in an engaging and hands-on manner without having to delve too deeply into mathematics.

Search engines, machine translation, and mobile applications all rely on deep learning technologies. It works by stimulating the human brain in terms of identifying and creating patterns from various types of input.

Applications of Feedforward Neural Network
These neural networks area unit used for many applications. A number of them area units mentioned as follows.

Physiological feedforward system: during this, the feedforward management is epitomized by the conventional prevenient regulation of heartbeat prior to work out by the central involuntary

Gene regulation and feedforward: during this, a motif preponderantly seems altogether the illustrious networks and this motif has been shown to be a feedforward system for the detection of the non-temporary modification of atmosphere.

Automation and machine management: feedforward control may be discipline among the sphere of automation controls utilized in

Parallel feedforward compensation with derivative: This a rather new technique that changes the part of AN open-loop transfer operates of a non-minimum part system into the minimum part.



A feedforward neural network is a key component of this fantastic technology since it aids software developers with pattern recognition and classification, non-linear regression, and function approximation.
implement a multi-layer feed-forward neural network with back- propagation for classification tasks. It should be possible for the user to specify (in the code) the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer. 

Choose at least three benchmark datasets from a public repository and four hyperparameters in order to perform parameter tuning to optimize predictive performance (accuracy) for each data set. 
The source code should include justifications for the choice of hyperparameters as well as the interval and step size used for parameter tuning.
